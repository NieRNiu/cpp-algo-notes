Daily C++ algorithm practice and notes 💻✨

## 📌 About

This repository is dedicated to recording my daily C++ algorithm practice, including implementations of common algorithms, data structures, and summaries of classic problems.

## 🏃‍♂️ Goals

- Practice at least one algorithm problem every day
- Systematically build up a library of algorithm templates
- Improve code comments and solution explanations over time
- Prepare for interviews, competitions, and strengthen fundamental skills

## 🗂️ Contents

- [x] Basic algorithms: sorting, searching, etc.
- [x] Data structures: linked lists, trees, graphs, etc.
- [x] Advanced techniques: dynamic programming, greedy, divide and conquer
- [x] Common interview and variant problems
- [ ] More coming soon...

## 💬 Discussion

Feel free to open issues or discuss problem-solving ideas. Let's learn and improve together!
